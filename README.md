# Syzygy Free Fall Kinematics Solver and Tutor

This is a web application that helps students learn and practice solving free fall kinematics problems. The application allows users to input the initial height and velocity of an object and calculates various parameters, such as the time of flight, maximum height, and impact velocity. The application also includes a step-by-step tutor feature that guides the user through the solution process.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you will need to have node.js installed on your computer. You can download it here [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/LukeAnger/syzygy.git
cd syzygy
npm install
```


## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:


```
npm run dev
```


This will start the server and launch the application in your browser with hot reloading enabled, so you can make changes to the code and see them in real-time.

## Deployment

The application is currently deployed at [lukeanger.com/syzygy](https://lukeanger.com/syzygy). To deploy the application to a different server, you can use the following command:

```
npm run build
```


This will create a build directory with the compiled application files that can be deployed to a server of your choice.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- React
- Chart.js

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Syzygy, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub. We welcome any and all contributions! Currently looking to improve the string parsing via regex or switch over to AI text parseing. I am also going to start adding other areas of physics such as Ohm's Law, 2-D kinematics and then branch out into other disciplines like chemistry and calculus. I welcome any and all contributions!
